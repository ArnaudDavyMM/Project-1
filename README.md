# Sales Store Project

The main goal of this project is to perform Time Series Analysis and forecast sales using various Machine Learning algorithms.

I divide the project into two (2) Parts. The first part is focused on Data Analysis and the second focuses on various Machine Learning.
I decided to do that separately due to computationanl power I have with google coloab in order to not exceed the GPU limit.

in sum, there will be 3 sub-project as follow:
1. Store Sales TimeSeries EDA
2. Store Sales TimeSeries Analys & Forecast using Statmodels (ARIMA, SARIMA)
3. Store Sales TimeSeries Analys & Forecast with Facebook Prophet
4. Store Sales TimeSeries Analys & Forecast with Ensemble algorithms
5. Store Sales TimeSeries Analys & Forecast with Deep Learning (Neural Network including LSTM)
